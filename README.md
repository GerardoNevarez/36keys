# So what we got here then? 

Behold. Here are some really basic PCBs that only support kailh choc low profile switches.

Currently they mostly have 36 keys (or less) which I consider to be as small as a keyboard can be without resorting to chording or other shenanigans.

Proceed with caution, and a little apprehension.

## Quick facts

Basically the 'normal' version of each type of keyboard are [Besom R](36keys/besom-r) (for 36 keys) and [Cradio F](34keys/cradio-f) (for 34 keys)

## About

The splits are heavily influenced by the following keyboards, and actually based on foostan's corne-light pin layout and pcb. 

* 5plit
* Gergoplex
* crkbd
* Kyria
* Jian/Jorne/Jorian
* Ferris
* Squiggle

## Caseless

These are all supposed to be used caseless and have no holes for cases or anything fancy.

## Firmware

Most 36 key split pcbs can use the crkbd firmware, but not the ones with no diodes, these all use the cradio firmware, maybe such things can be found [here](qmk). 
There is also a stripped back 36 key firmware called cranorm, which can be used instead of the crkbd firmware.

## FAQs

Aren't all the splits basically the same board with the keys shuffled around? Yes.

### 36 keys

* Besom r - Screen reversible pm footprint
* Besom 10x10 - 36 keys on less than a 10x10pcb
* Besom Ortho - ortho.
* Besom Ortho Drop - Droppped pinky
* Besom S - No Screen 1 way pm
* Besom Pure - No Screen reversible pm footprint

### 34 keys
* Cradio F - Has thumbs like the ferris
* Cradio S - Flat thumbs
* Cradio 10 - 34 keys on less than a 10x10pcb
* Sweep - Ferris type clone with choc spacing and promicros and nice sweeping ferris logo courtesy of the very kind [Pierre](https://github.com/pierrechevalier83/)
