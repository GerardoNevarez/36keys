# So what we got here then? 

Behold. Here are some really basic PCBs that only support kailh choc low profile switches.

Currently they mostly have 36 keys (or less) which I consider to be as small as a keyboard can be without resorting to chording or other shenanigans.

Proceed with caution, and a little apprehension.

These are heavily influenced by the following keyboards, and actually based on foostan's simple corne pin layout and pcb. 

* 5plit
* Gergoplex
* crkbd
* Kyria
* Jian/Jorne/Jorian

## Keyboards

### Beak
[link](beak)
Has a curve

### BeakX
[link](beakX)
Has a better curve

### Crab10x10
[link](crab-10x10)
Basically a 5plit, with serial instead of i2c.

### Crab-ortho
[link](crab-ortho)
36 keys in grid form

### Crab
[link](crab)
This was the first pcb, sort of like a gergoplex with promicros

### Macro 1
[link](macro1)
Five keys one encoder. 

### Macro 3
[link](macro1)
Six keys two encoders. 

### Nodi
[link](nodi)
34 keys no diodes.  

### Noip
[link](noip)
Simplist asetniop board.


## Caseless

These are all supposed to be used caseless and have no holes for cases or anything fancy.

## Firmware

All these pcbs can use the crkbd firmware. 

## Why crab? 
Crab is the alternative name for the medium invader, from space invaders, which the original board superficially resembled.

## Build

All splits are asymmetric builds, the controllers are facing down on the left side and up on the right (see picture).

Only one screen can be used; on the left (which covers the flat back of the microcontroller) - the right side already has cool components showing, one screen is unnecessary, two screens is just silly. 

## FAQs

Aren't all the splits basically the same board with the keys shuffled around? Yes.
