# So what we got here then?

Behold. Here are some really basic PCBs that only support kailh choc low profile switches.

Currently they mostly have 36 keys (or less) which I consider to be as small as a keyboard can be without resorting to chording or other shenanigans.

Proceed with caution, and a little apprehension.

The splits are heavily influenced by the following keyboards, and actually based on foostan's corne-light pin layout and pcb. 

* 5plit
* Gergoplex
* crkbd
* Kyria
* Jian/Jorne/Jorian
* Ferris
* Squiggle

## Caseless

These are all supposed to be used caseless and have no holes for cases or anything fancy.

## Firmware

Most split pcbs can use the crkbd firmware, but not the ones with no diodes. Maybe such things can be found [here](qmk).


## FAQs

Aren't all the splits basically the same board with the keys shuffled around? Yes.
